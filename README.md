## Introduction
This is a python module that takes in a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.

* The module contains a Python Class **media.py** to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
* You can create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
* **fresh_tomatoes.py** has a function called **open_movies_page** that takes a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.

A sample is included in **entertainment_center.py**.

## Prerequisites
* <h4>Install <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>

## Instructions
* <h4>You can create a list of movie objects in entertainment_center.py by calling the constructor media.Movie() to instantiate movie objects.</h4>
* <h4>You’ve given movies their own custom data structure by using the movie class and constructor, and now these objects can be stored in a list data structure.</h4>
* <h4> This list of movies is what the open_movies_page() function needs as input in order to build the HTML file, so you can display your website.</h4>
