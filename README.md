# Movie Trailer Website Application
A python module that has server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You can use this to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

## Introduction
This is a python module that takes in a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.

* The module contains a Python Class **media.py** to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
* You can create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
* **fresh_tomatoes.py** has a function called **open_movies_page** that takes a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.

A sample is included in **entertainment_center.py**.

## Prerequisites
* <h4>Install <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>

## Instructions
* You can create a list of movie objects in **entertainment_center.py** by calling the constructor **media.Movie()** to instantiate movie objects.
* Youâ€™ve given movies their own custom data structure by using the movie class and constructor, and now these objects can be stored in a list data structure.
* This list of movies is what the **open_movies_page()** function needs as input in order to build the HTML file, so you can display your website.
